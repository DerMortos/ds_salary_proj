Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes. Applies and integrates statistical, mathematical, predictive modeling and business analysis skills to manage and manipulate complex high volume data from a variety of sources.

About us:
Target is an iconic brand, a Fortune 50 company and one of America’s leading retailers.
Behind one of the world’s best loved brands, is a uniquely capable and brilliant team of data analysts, scientists, product owners and engineers. The testing and measurement team drives continuous innovation and business growth through experimentation using testing and measurement philosophy for Target stores, Target.com and Target Mobile. The testing and measurement team plays a key role in identifying, testing and measuring the top growth opportunities at any given time. We are here to help Target improve the guest experience, whether guests shop us in stores, on Target.com or on Target Mobile.
A role with Target’s testing and measurement team is a chance to help develop our in-house strength for quantifying the impact or minimizing the risk for a broad range of initiatives. Sometimes those initiatives are customer-facing as our clients look to optimize their business, but other times we apply advanced analytical methodologies on the internal products and processes our data sciences teams develop. We are in the process of adopting a responsible AI framework this person will champion and teach to others. As such, this role will be independent of modeling teams and will develop an independent perspective measuring possible unintended consequences for a broad range of algorithms.
About the Job:
Partner Consultation
You’ll work closely with business, analyst, scientist, and teams to identify and prioritize existing models for exploration
This requires someone passionate about data, modern customer prediction methods both online and offline, and the ability to bring objectivity to measuring impacts of current processes
Improve Decision Making
You’ll define the approach, develop the roadmap and lead ongoing review routines
You’ll design and deliver insights using a mixture of analytical and visualization techniques
Job duties may change at any time due to business and product needs
About you:
You are an expert in research areas such as measuring bias, ethics governance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, artificial intelligence ethics
You have deep applied experience with the customer predictive model process, including attribute screening, using 3rd party data attributes and the overall scoring process
You understand how to identify model bias, predictor drift and best practices for reporting on both
You understand “protected class” predictors, and current industry trends across the data privacy conversation
5-7 years of work experience in customer analytics, personalization, consulting, or data engineering roles
Experience with analytics tools such as: DOMO, Hadoop/Hive, R, Python, Spark, and equivalent technologies
Bachelor’s degree with strong academic performance in a quantitative field; or strong equivalent experience
This position may be considered for a Full-Time Remote or Hybrid work arrangement based on Target’s needs. A Hybrid work arrangement means the team members core role will be a blend of virtual and onsite at a Target location. A Full-Time Remote work arrangement means the team member works full-time from home or an alternate location that’s not a Target location, does not have a desk at their primary HQ work location and may travel to HQ up to 4 times a year.
The salary range is $118,200-$212,800.
Pay is based on several factors including but not limited to education, work experience, certifications, etc. In addition to your salary, Target cares about and invests in you as a team member, so that you can take care of yourself and your family.

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes. Applies and integrates statistical, mathematical, predictive modeling and business analysis skills to manage and manipulate complex high volume data from a variety of sources.

Compensation Minimum:$111,200 Annual
Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes.

Compensation Minimum:$111,200 Annual
Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes. Applies and integrates statistical, mathematical, predictive modeling and business analysis skills to manage and manipulate complex high volume data from a variety of sources.

Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes.

Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes.

Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies.

Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies.

Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes. Applies and integrates statistical, mathematical, predictive modeling and business analysis skills to manage and manipulate complex high volume data from a variety of sources.

Compensation Minimum:$111,200 Annual
Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies.

Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes.

Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes.

Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will...

Compensation Maximum:$194,900 Annual
Summary:
American Family Insurance is a Fortune 300 company, the 7th largest insurer in the U.S., and one of the fastest growing. We are a mutual insurance company, which means that our customers are also the owners of our business. This gives us a different perspective – and culture – than many of our publicly-traded competitors. We are constantly evaluating how to best service our customer/owners, and to support our employees, and have a strong ethic of also supporting the communities in which our customers and employees live. While delivering value at low cost is important, AmFam truly seeks to improve our customers’ lives and communities beyond insurance – empowering us to “dream fearlessly.”

The insurance industry touches nearly every American’s life. While American Family does not provide health “insurance,” more than 10 million American’s homes, cars, farms, small businesses, and other property are insured by AmFam. Insurance is a crucial part of the economy, enabling people to live their lives without concern for bankruptcy around every turn.

Our unique culture is critical given the current industry climate. Because of the size and scale of insurance, the industry is undergoing rapid transformation, attracting attention from smaller market entrants. Changes in society, technology, and consumer expectations are spurring start-up driven disruption of our industry. American Family has been a leader in responding to these new challenges, investing heavily in innovation and developing new methods to address these changes across a range of new opportunities and technologies.

The Data Science & Analytics Lab (DSAL) is one of the results of this innovation investment. Created eight+ years ago, DSAL is charged with using AI and machine learning (ML) to drive transformational value for American Family. Thus our primary role is to conceive, develop, and deliver data science- and engineering-driven initiatives that are focused on creating real impact.

DSAL is an ideal environment for those seeking to innovate and make an impact. We are a relatively small team and, in many ways, more like a startup than a large company, though leveraging large company funding, connections, reach, and distribution. We are charged with helping to re-envision insurance in light of the technical, societal, and consumer changes underway. One major component of these changes is the “data explosion” currently ongoing – the vast increase in data available in the world as a result of the internet, mobile phones, social media, and the wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Given that data are the raw materials of the insurance industry – our products and services are manufactured using data – understanding, evaluating, and then using these new data sources are critical to our future.

During our first eight years, DSAL has evaluated and used some of these new data sources, and found new ways to better leverage existing data sources. While our work is diverse and varied, we find that generally we create the most value at the intersection of large proprietary data sets and difficult prediction problems. We typically have 2-4 relatively large initiatives underway at any point in time, but we also diligently work to set aside time for ongoing exploratory activity as well – so that we can find the next high-value initiative. Furthermore, we highly value ongoing learning and aren’t afraid to work with the latest tools, technologies, and open source code. As a result, we encourage team members to attend scientific and technical conferences in order to stay up-to-date with advancements in their respective disciplines.

As a Data Scientist, you will... Develops, analyzes and models operational, economic, management, accounting and other organizational data to quantify the competitive performance of business segments, evaluate potential operational changes, and design new approaches and methodologies. Analyzes organizational data to recommend solutions to new and complex problems, develops innovative strategies, quantifies the competitive performance of the organization's operations and/or markets; models and evaluates the potential impact of changes. Applies and integrates statistical, mathematical, predictive modeling and business analysis skills to manage and manipulate complex high volume data from a variety of sources.
